## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python Flask**: RESTful API development
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data processing
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Responsive design with modern styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Interactive functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

### Deployment
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file serving
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI server for production

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd travel-explorer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Flask application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

4. **Serve frontend files**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Production Deployment

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: `http://localhost`
   - API: `http://localhost/api/`

## API Endpoints

### Transport Search
```http
POST /api/search_transport
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mode": "train",
  "location": "Mumbai",
  "date": "2024-12-25"
}
```

### Itinerary Generation
```http
POST /api/generate_itinerary
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "location": "Delhi",
  "duration": 3
}
```

### Get Locations
```http
GET /api/locations
```

### Health Check
```http
GET /api/health
```

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Content-Based Recommender
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts location features into numerical vectors
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between locations
- **Use Case**: Finding similar destinations for recommendations

### 2. Transport Mode Optimizer
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Considers distance, budget, time, and comfort
- **Rule-based Intelligence**: Applies domain knowledge for recommendations
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjusts scores based on user preferences

### 3. Itinerary Generator
- **Activity Sequencing**: Intelligent ordering of daily activities
- **Location Feature Analysis**: Tailors activities to destination characteristics
- **Personalization**: Adapts recommendations based on duration and preferences

### Model Configuration
ML models are initialized on application startup with predefined location data. The system can be extended by:

1. Adding more location data to `load_location_data()`
2. Modifying feature weights in recommendation algorithms
3. Implementing additional ML models for enhanced personalization
